I am a cybersecurity student at Sapienza University of Rome. 

I attended the [cyberchallenge.it](cyberchallenge.it) 2024 national program and was able to qualify for the finals in Turin with [Universit√† di Roma Tor Vergata](https://web.uniroma2.it/).

Currently developing a master thesis on the [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) compiler with particular focus on profile guided optimization under the supervision of Prof. Daniele Cono D'Elia.
