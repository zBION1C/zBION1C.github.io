## Why a documentation site matters

Every diagnostic code needs a public documentation page. It serves three audiences:

1. **Developers** encountering the error in their terminal or logs can click the `see:` URL and get immediate guidance
2. **AI agents** (Claude, Copilot, etc.) can fetch the page to help when a user pastes an error
3. **Search engines** index these pages so developers searching for `NUXT_B2011` find the answer directly

## Setting up docsBase

The `docsBase` option in `defineDiagnostics()` controls the auto-generated `docs` URL. It can be a string or a function:

```ts
// Function form — full control over the URL
const diagnostics = defineDiagnostics({
  docsBase: (code) => `https://nuxt.com/e/${code.replace('NUXT_', '').toLowerCase()}`,
  codes: {
    NUXT_B2011: { why: '...' },
  },
})
// diagnostics.NUXT_B2011().docs → 'https://nuxt.com/e/b2011'
```

```ts
// String form — code appended automatically as ${docsBase}/${code.toLowerCase()}
const diagnostics = defineDiagnostics({
  docsBase: 'https://example.com/errors',
  codes: {
    MY_E001: { why: '...' },
  },
})
// diagnostics.MY_E001().docs → 'https://example.com/errors/my_e001'
```

Plan your URL structure accordingly.

## Documentation page structure

Each error code page (e.g. `https://nuxt.com/e/b2011`) should follow this structure. The content must be both human-readable and optimized for AI agent consumption. Use clear headings, concise language, and structured sections.

### Required sections

**Title and code identifier**

```markdown
# NUXT_B2011: Invalid plugin — src option is required

Code: `NUXT_B2011`
Level: error
```

Start with the code and a short title. Include the code and the severity level.

**What this error means**

```markdown
## What this error means

This error occurs when a plugin is registered via `addPlugin()` without providing a
valid `src` path. Nuxt requires every plugin to have a source file so it can be
resolved and included in the build.
```

Explain the error in plain language. Assume the reader has no prior context. Describe what the system expected versus what it received. AI agents rely on this section to explain the error to users.

**Why this happens**

```markdown
## Why this happens

Common causes:

- Passing an object to `addPlugin()` without a `src` property
- Passing `undefined` or `null` as the plugin path
- A module is constructing a plugin object dynamically and the `src` field is missing
  due to a conditional branch or typo
```

List the concrete scenarios that trigger this diagnostic as bullets. Each bullet should describe a specific situation the developer might be in.

**How to fix it**

````markdown
## How to fix it

Ensure every call to `addPlugin()` includes a valid `src` path:

```ts
// Wrong
addPlugin({ name: 'my-plugin' })

// Correct
addPlugin({ src: resolve('./runtime/my-plugin'), name: 'my-plugin' })

// Also correct — pass a string directly
addPlugin(resolve('./runtime/my-plugin'))
```

If the plugin path is computed dynamically, verify the variable is defined before
passing it to `addPlugin()`.
````

Provide concrete code examples showing the wrong pattern and the corrected version. This is the most important section; it should be copy-pasteable.

### Optional sections

**Additional context**

```markdown
## Additional context

- This validation was added in Nuxt 3.2
- If you are writing a Nuxt module, see the [Module Author Guide](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/going-further/modules)
- Related codes: [NUXT_B1001](./nuxt_b1001) (template compilation), [NUXT_B3005](./nuxt_b3005) (module resolution)
```

Link to related documentation, changelog entries, or related diagnostic codes.

**Example diagnostic output**

````markdown
## Example output

```
[NUXT_B2011] Invalid plugin`/plugins/bad.ts`. src option is required.
├▶ why:  plugin object was passed without a src path
├▶ fix: Pass a string path or an object with a `src`property to`addPlugin()`.
├▶ hint: Check your module's addPlugin() calls
╰▶ see: https://nuxt.com/e/b2011
```
````

Show what the user actually sees in their terminal so they can confirm they're on the right page.

## Page template

Use this template for each error code page:

```markdown
# {CODE}: {Short title}

Code: `{CODE}`
Level: {error|warn|suggestion|deprecation}

## What this error means

{Plain-language explanation of the diagnostic. 1-3 sentences.}

## Why this happens

{Bulleted list of concrete scenarios that trigger this diagnostic.}

## How to fix it

{Code examples showing the wrong pattern and the corrected version.}

## Additional context

{Links to related docs, changelog, or related diagnostic codes. Optional.}

## Example output

{Terminal output showing the formatted diagnostic. Optional.}
```

## Deployment recommendations

Host the error code pages on a public URL that matches your `docsBase`:

- **GitHub Pages or static site generator** (VitePress, Nuxt Content, etc.): create a directory of markdown files, one per code, with a catch-all route at `/e/[code].md`
- **Dedicated `/errors` or `/e` route** in your existing documentation site
- Return proper HTTP status codes (200 for valid codes, 404 for unknown ones) so agents and crawlers can tell valid codes from missing ones
- Add `<meta>` tags or frontmatter with structured data (code, level, title) to help agents and search engines parse pages
- Keep pages lightweight. Avoid heavy JavaScript or SPAs that block content rendering for fetch-based agents.

## Keeping docs in sync with code

- Store documentation markdown alongside your diagnostic definitions or in a dedicated `docs/errors/` directory
- Generate an index page listing all codes with their messages and levels
- In CI, validate that every code in `defineDiagnostics()` has a corresponding documentation page. Fail the build if a page is missing.
- When adding a new diagnostic code, add the documentation page in the same PR

## Optimizing for AI agent consumption

Structure pages so an AI agent fetching the URL can extract the right information without ambiguity:

- Use consistent heading hierarchy (`##` for sections)
- Put the most actionable content (fix instructions) early
- Avoid hiding critical information in collapsed sections, tabs, or JavaScript-rendered content
- Include the code in the page title and body so keyword matching works
- Keep code examples self-contained: an agent should be able to suggest the fix from the page content alone.
